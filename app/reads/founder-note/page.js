            <p>
              i started pxlcorp because i needed a space to build, learn, and figure things out in public.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              i'm not from a fancy background. i'm 19, still learning, and just getting started. 
              but i've got big goals â€” i want to build real products, run legendary companies,  
              and make things the internet hasn't seen before.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              pxlcorp is my way of getting there.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              right now, i'm building it solo. not because i don't want a team â€”  
              but because i want to understand the entire journey. the tech, the design, the brand, the systems.  
              every part of it.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              i want to earn my skills, brick by brick.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              but i won't do it alone forever. <br />
              if you vibe with this energy â€” if you love building from scratch, experimenting, failing in public,  
              and figuring it out along the way â€” come join me.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              pxlcorp isn't a startup yet. it's a tiny internet lab. <br />
              a place where ideas are tested.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              i'll share what i'm learning, what i'm shipping, and where this all goes. <br />
              i hope y'all are excited for pxlcorp's journey !
            </p>
